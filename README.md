### Documentations coming soon!

### A note about feature requests and contributions

The wrapper does not implement all Steamworks interfaces and functions. If you miss something, feel free to [contact me](mailto:codi@code-disaster.com), or just open a [new issue](https://github.com/code-disaster/steamworks4j/issues) right here on GitHub. Of course, pull requests are welcome too.
